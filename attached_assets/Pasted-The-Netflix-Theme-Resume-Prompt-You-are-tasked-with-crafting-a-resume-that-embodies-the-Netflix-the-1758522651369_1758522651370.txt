The Netflix Theme Resume Prompt
You are tasked with crafting a resume that embodies the "Netflix theme" by presenting the candidate's professional life as a compelling narrative. This is not a traditional list of duties, but a story of high-stakes challenges, unexpected twists, and a morally gray protagonist who achieves extraordinary outcomes.

Your resume development should be guided by the following principles:

Mood: The Unsettled Urgency. The mood of the resume should feel like a season of a Netflix show—every bullet point is a scene, and every job is a season. It creates a sense of quiet tension and high-stakes urgency. Instead of stating, "Managed a team," you should hint at the emotional and professional challenges involved: "Navigated a team through a hostile corporate merger, securing key talent and ensuring project continuity despite departmental layoffs." The language should be active and create a sense of impending action.

Action: The Slow Burn of Impact. Your resume should not be a list of tasks but a chronicle of deliberate, high-impact actions. Frame your accomplishments as major plot points. Don't just list a project; describe the initial problem, the unexpected obstacles, and the surprising resolution. For example, instead of "Increased sales by 15%," tell the story: "Inherited a failing sales pipeline; implemented a controversial but data-driven strategy that reversed the decline and ultimately grew revenue by 15% in a single quarter." The action is messy, deliberate, and has clear consequences.

Behavior: The Morally Gray Professional. This is the most crucial part. Your resume character isn't perfect. They made tough calls, took risks, and solved problems in unorthodox ways. Acknowledge and reframe professional "failures" as learning moments or as a consequence of a morally complex decision. Your narrative should show a person who is not afraid to challenge the status quo and is more interested in the truth of their professional journey than a sanitized version. Acknowledge a project that failed but then show what you did to mitigate the damage. This makes the character more relatable and authentic, just like a protagonist you'd see on screen.

Your Task: Using a real or fictional professional, create a resume for a single job or a series of jobs that captures this tone. Focus on crafting a compelling Summary or Objective that sets the stage, followed by Experience bullet points that read like episodic plot summaries. Your goal is to make the hiring manager feel like they are "binge-watching" your career, eager to see what happens next.
